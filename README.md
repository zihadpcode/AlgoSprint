# AlgoSprint

An original coding interview preparation platform built incrementally with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Zod, and Supabase Auth.

## 🟦 Current checkpoint: Phase 12 paused, draft PR #13

Phase 11 is merged. Phase 12 is **unfinished and paused at the user's request** in [draft PR #13](https://github.com/zihadpcode/AlgoSprint/pull/13), branch `algosprint/phase-12-roadmaps`. Main remains at Phase 11; do not merge or resume fixes until the user continues.

The draft adds public roadmap list/detail pages, two original paths through the existing five problems, ordered steps, private progress and next-step suggestions. Seeding validates references, preserves identical existing paths and refuses conflicting edits. No schema or dependency changes were made.

**135 local unit/component/migration tests**, seed validation, lint, TypeScript, production build and unconfigured HTTP checks pass. Seven new PostgreSQL integration tests and the seeded roadmap HTTP checks await observed CI evidence. No live account/provider/browser checks or deployment occurred.

Read [the Phase 12 checkpoint guide](docs/PHASE-12-GUIDE.md), with all 23 changed source/test/script files, and [the session handoff](docs/SESSION-HANDOFF.md) for the exact remaining work. Phase 13 has not started.

## 🟩 Run locally

Use Node.js 24 and npm:

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Preserve an existing configured `.env.local` instead of overwriting it. Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

For accounts, configure `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, and `APP_URL`. Use a current `sb_publishable_` key. Follow [the Phase 3 setup guide](docs/PHASE-3-GUIDE.md) for Supabase email confirmations, redirect URLs, and admin provisioning. Keep all database passwords and private keys out of Git and chat.

```bash
npm run db:deploy
npm run db:seed
```

`DIRECT_URL`, if set, is used for migration/seeding instead of the runtime connection. `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` is optional for creating future development migrations. Do not use migration resets on valuable data.

## 🟩 Verify

```bash
npm run db:validate
npm run seed:validate
npm test
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run test:smoke
```

`npm run test:integration` requires a dedicated empty PostgreSQL database whose name ends in `_test`; set `TEST_DATABASE_URL` to it and apply migrations there first. GitHub CI supplies PostgreSQL 17 and also runs `npm run test:smoke` against a temporary production server with accounts deliberately unconfigured. These checks do not prove live Supabase email delivery or authentication; use the manual checklist in the Phase 3 guide.

## 🟥 Security model

Supabase owns passwords. The server verifies identity with `getUser()` and reads the role from the application database. Signup never accepts a role. Account cookies are HttpOnly and use Secure in production; there is no browser auth client. Protected data must be authorized in each server query/action, not just in a layout or navigation menu.

Tables live in private `app` with RLS and revoked untrusted-role access. The trusted Prisma owner can bypass RLS, so ownership checks remain essential. Select only public fields for browser responses; never bundle seed JSON, hidden tests, or internal submission results. Do not execute submitted code in the app server.

## 🟪 Road ahead

Phase 9 is implemented and documented; live-provider/account/browser verification remains pending. Phase 10 is implemented and documented. Phase 11 is implemented and documented; the fixture failure is resolved. Phase 12 builds original roadmaps. Roadmaps, admin authoring, generators, interviews and deployment remain later phases. Reviewed original content grows from 5 to 20 to 100 to 1,000 problems.
