# AlgoSprint

An original coding interview preparation platform built incrementally with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Zod, and Supabase Auth.

## 🟨 Current checkpoint: Phase 10 halfway pause

**Phase 9 is merged** in [PR #10](https://github.com/zihadpcode/AlgoSprint/pull/10), with all 130 tests and CI checks passing. It remains the completed milestone on main.

This branch, `algosprint/phase-10-dashboard-part-1`, is the first of two Phase 10 milestones, saved as an **unmerged draft** at the user's requested halfway stop. It replaces dashboard introductory content with six live summary cards and labeled solved-by-difficulty/category charts using the existing private progress query. No schema, dependency or seed content changes are included.

**Remaining for the second half:** weak-topic analysis, recommended problems, recent submissions on the dashboard, and streak behavior or an explicit placeholder. Existing recent activity stays available on `/progress`. Do not merge this partial phase or continue feature work until the user resumes.

Read [the Part 1 guide](docs/PHASE-10-PART-1-GUIDE.md) for beginner explanations, setup, all six source/test files and the manual checklist. The [session handoff](docs/SESSION-HANDOFF.md) records the stop point; the draft PR linked from this branch records its exact head and CI result. Local checks passed 105 tests, lint, types, build and protected HTTP smoke. Live Supabase/Judge0 and browser verification remain pending; nothing was deployed.

## 🟩 Run locally

Use Node.js 24 and npm:

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Preserve an existing configured `.env.local` instead of overwriting it. Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

For accounts, configure `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, and `APP_URL`. Use a current `sb_publishable_` key. Follow [the Phase 3 setup guide](docs/PHASE-3-GUIDE.md) for Supabase email confirmations, redirect URLs, and admin provisioning. Keep all database passwords and private keys out of Git and chat.

```bash
npm run db:deploy
npm run db:seed
```

`DIRECT_URL`, if set, is used for migration/seeding instead of the runtime connection. `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` is optional for creating future development migrations. Do not use migration resets on valuable data.

## 🟩 Verify

```bash
npm run db:validate
npm run seed:validate
npm test
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run test:smoke
```

`npm run test:integration` requires a dedicated empty PostgreSQL database whose name ends in `_test`; set `TEST_DATABASE_URL` to it and apply migrations there first. GitHub CI supplies PostgreSQL 17 and also runs `npm run test:smoke` against a temporary production server with accounts deliberately unconfigured. These checks do not prove live Supabase email delivery or authentication; use the manual checklist in the Phase 3 guide.

## 🟥 Security model

Supabase owns passwords. The server verifies identity with `getUser()` and reads the role from the application database. Signup never accepts a role. Account cookies are HttpOnly and use Secure in production; there is no browser auth client. Protected data must be authorized in each server query/action, not just in a layout or navigation menu.

Tables live in private `app` with RLS and revoked untrusted-role access. The trusted Prisma owner can bypass RLS, so ownership checks remain essential. Select only public fields for browser responses; never bundle seed JSON, hidden tests, or internal submission results. Do not execute submitted code in the app server.

## 🟪 Road ahead

Phase 9 is implemented and documented; live-provider/account/browser verification remains pending. Phase 10 is paused after its first dashboard milestone; finish the remaining analytics features on resume. Later phases add notes/bookmarks management, roadmaps, admin authoring, generators, interviews and deployment. Reviewed original content grows from 5 to 20 to 100 to 1,000 problems.
