# AlgoSprint

An original coding interview preparation platform built incrementally with Next.js, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, PostgreSQL, Prisma, Zod, and Supabase Auth.

## 🟩 Current milestone: Phase 6 — guided problem pages

Phases 1–5 are merged. Phase 6 is implemented in [PR #7](https://github.com/zihadpcode/AlgoSprint/pull/7): published problem statements, examples, constraints, progressive hints, solution tabs, starter code, related challenges, private notes, and manual solved/review controls.

Open `/problems` after configuring PostgreSQL, applying migrations, and seeding, then select a problem. Public reading needs no account. Private notes and progress require verified sign-in. Manual solves are labeled self-marked; no editor or code runner exists yet. Unknown/unpublished problems return 404, and missing database configuration shows a preparation state.

Read [the complete Phase 6 guide](docs/PHASE-6-GUIDE.md) for exact commands, all 19 authored source files, explanations, concurrency rules and testing. [The handoff](docs/SESSION-HANDOFF.md) and PR #7 record validation and publication status.

The coding workspace is available again. Local unit/migration tests, lint, types, build and unconfigured production HTTP checks have passed. Full implementation [CI passed](https://github.com/zihadpcode/AlgoSprint/actions/runs/34905876549): 55 unit/migration tests, 17 PostgreSQL integration tests, schema/seed validation, lint, types, build and both production HTTP checks. Browser interaction/visual checks and real Supabase account validation remain outstanding. Nothing has been deployed.

## 🟩 Run locally

Use Node.js 24 and npm:

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env.local
npm run dev
```

Preserve an existing configured `.env.local` instead of overwriting it. Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

For accounts, configure `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, and `APP_URL`. Use a current `sb_publishable_` key. Follow [the Phase 3 setup guide](docs/PHASE-3-GUIDE.md) for Supabase email confirmations, redirect URLs, and admin provisioning. Keep all database passwords and private keys out of Git and chat.

```bash
npm run db:deploy
npm run db:seed
```

`DIRECT_URL`, if set, is used for migration/seeding instead of the runtime connection. `SHADOW_DATABASE_URL` is optional for creating future development migrations. Do not use migration resets on valuable data.

## 🟩 Verify

```bash
npm run db:validate
npm run seed:validate
npm test
npm run lint
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run test:smoke
```

`npm run test:integration` requires a dedicated empty PostgreSQL database whose name ends in `_test`; set `TEST_DATABASE_URL` to it and apply migrations there first. GitHub CI supplies PostgreSQL 17 and also runs `npm run test:smoke` against a temporary production server with accounts deliberately unconfigured. These checks do not prove live Supabase email delivery or authentication; use the manual checklist in the Phase 3 guide.

## 🟥 Security model

Supabase owns passwords. The server verifies identity with `getUser()` and reads the role from the application database. Signup never accepts a role. Account cookies are HttpOnly and use Secure in production; there is no browser auth client. Protected data must be authorized in each server query/action, not just in a layout or navigation menu.

Tables live in private `app` with RLS and revoked untrusted-role access. The trusted Prisma owner can bypass RLS, so ownership checks remain essential. Select only public fields for browser responses; never bundle seed JSON, hidden tests, or internal submission results. Do not execute submitted code in the app server.

## 🟪 Road ahead

Phase 6 delivers guided study and per-problem personal controls. The next milestone is Phase 7 Monaco editing, followed by isolated execution, richer progress, analytics, the notes/bookmarks manager, roadmaps, admin authoring, generators, interviews, and deployment. Content grows from 5 to 20 to 100 to 1,000 reviewed problems. All statements, hints, explanations, roadmap names, branding, and UI must be original.
